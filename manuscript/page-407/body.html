Maryanka replied quietly.</p><p>'Do tell me just this once what has passed between you and Lukishka?'</p><p>'What has passed? A match was proposed. Father put it off for a year, but now it's been settled and they'll marry us in autumn.'</p><p>'But what did he say to you?' Maryanka smiled.</p><p>'What should he say? He said he loved me. He kept asking me to come to the vineyards with him.'</p><p>'Just see what pitch! But you didn't go, did you? And what a dare-devil he has become: the first among the braves. He makes merry out there in the army too! The other day our Kirka came home; he says: "What a horse Lukashka's got in exchange!" But all the same I expect he frets after you. And what else did he say?'</p></div> </div>
