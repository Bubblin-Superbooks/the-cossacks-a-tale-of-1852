<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>'Well, good-bye, my lad!' said Daddy Eroshka. 'When you go on an expedition, be wise and listen to my wordsâ€”the words of an old man. When you are out on a raid or the like (you know I'm an old wolf and have seen things), and when they begin firing, don't get into a crowd where there are many men. When you fellows get frightened you always try to get close together with a lot of others. You think it is merrier to be with others, but that's where it is worst of all! They always aim at a crowd. Now I used to keep farther away from the others and went alone, and I've never been wounded. Yet what things haven't I seen in my day?'</p></div> </div>
