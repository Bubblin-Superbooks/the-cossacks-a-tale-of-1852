'Are you bringing the skiff?' shouted Lukashka.</p><p>'You're a trump, Luke! Lug it to the bank!' shouted one of the Cossacks.</p><p>Without waiting for the skiff Lukashka began to undress, keeping an eye all the while on his prey.</p><p>'Wait a bit, Nazarka is bringing the skiff,' shouted the corporal.</p><p>'You fool! Maybe he is alive and only pretending! Take your dagger with you!' shouted another Cossack.</p><p>'Get along,' cried Luke, pulling off his trousers. He quickly undressed and, crossing himself, jumped, plunging with a splash into the river.

A crowd of Cossacks stood on the bank talking loudly.</p></div> </div>
