There's foolishness for you! They go, the poor fellows, all in a clump, and even sew red collars to their coats! How can they help being hit! One gets killed, they drag him away and another takes his place! What foolishness!' the old man repeated, shaking his head. 'Why not scatter, and go one by one? So you just go like that and they won't notice you. That's what you must do.'</p><p>'Well, thank you! Good-bye, Daddy. God willing we may meet again,' said Olenin, getting up and moving towards the passage.</p></div> </div>
