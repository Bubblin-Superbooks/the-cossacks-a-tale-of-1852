Well, listen, and repeat after me:</p><p>'Hail! Ye, living in Sion, This is your King, Our steeds we shall sit on, Sophonius is weeping. Zacharias is speaking, Father Pilgrim, Mankind ever loving.'</p><p>'Kind ever loving,' the old man repeated. 'Do you know it now? Try it.'</p><p>Lukashka laughed.</p><p>'Come, Daddy, was it that that hindered their killing you? Maybe it just happened so!'</p><p>'You've grown too clever! You learn it all, and say it. It will do you no harm. Well, suppose you have sung "Pilgrim", it's all right,' and the old man himself began laughing. 'But just one thing, Luke, don't you go to Nogay!'</p></div> </div>
