Are you getting married?' asked Olenin, greeting him merrily.</p><p>Lukashka gave no direct reply.</p><p>'There, I've exchanged your horse across the river. This is a horse! A Kabarda horse from the Lov stud. I know horses.'</p><p>They examined the new horse and made him caracole about the yard. The horse really was an exceptionally fine one, a broad and long gelding, with glossy coat, thick silky tail, and the soft fine mane and crest of a thoroughbred. He was so well fed that 'you might go to sleep on his back' as Lukashka expressed it. His hoofs, eyes, teeth, were exquisitely shaped and sharply outlined, as one only finds them in very pure-bred horses. Olenin could not help admiring the horse, he had not yet met with such a beauty in the Caucasus.</p></div> </div>
