He went on without knowing where the ditch would lead him. Suddenly the reeds behind him crackled. He shuddered and seized his gun, and then felt ashamed of himself: the over-excited dog, panting hard, had thrown itself into the cold water of the ditch and was lapping it!</p><p>He too had a drink, and then followed the dog in the direction it wished to go, thinking it would lead him to the village.

Some large birds circled screeching round their nests in those trees.</p></div> </div>
